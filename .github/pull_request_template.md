<!--
Thanks for your contribution, we appreciate it!

Please give some information about what you did and what versions of Neos the Pull Request is for.

If possible, try to keep backwards compatibility. So if you add support for a new version of Neos in the composer.json, 
still keep the old version in it, if the package still works with the old version of Neos.

For example 
  "neos/neos": "^4.0 || ^5.0" 
instead of just
  "neos/neos": "^5.0"

And one more thing... Don't forget about the tests!
